# Win at Sleeping

### Brief

To use data from a JSON file containing content to create an HTML page with all required CSS and JavaScript. The goal was to create a responsive page as per the supplied layouts.

### To launch

Clone this repository and drag `index.html` into the browser.

### I'd like to improve

The responsiveness of the 'tips' carousel isn't as slick as it could be, I'd be really interested to know how this could be improved upon.
